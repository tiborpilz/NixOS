# NixOS & Homemanager configuration

This is my NixOS and Home Manager configuration, which I use on my personal computer. NixOS is a Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager, and Home Manager is a Nix-based configuration management tool for configuring the user environment. This configuration uses the new Flakes feature in Nix to provide a more modular and flexible way of managing the configuration.
